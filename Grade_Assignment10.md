|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:|:------|
| 1 | The correct directory structure.                                                                    |   10     |   10  |
| 2 | Database RC created                                                                                 |   10     |   10  |
| 3 | Had access or link to every product image (either from thumbs or cdn).                              |   10     |   10  |
| 4 | Fix the max value (end of list) problem.                                                            |   20     |   20  |
| 5 | Fix the min value (beginning of list) problem, so it won't go below 0.                              |   20     |   20  |
| 6 | Fix the display of "0" so instead of displaying 0-20, it displays 1-20, etc.                        |   10     |   10  |
| 7 | Make the middle portion a drop down list of all available pages.                                    |   20     |   0  |
| 8 | Notes: -20 for page not displaying 
|   |                                                                                                     |   100    |  60  |

I'm giving you credit on the rest just by looking at your code, even though I should not grade it since the permissions
on the file wouldn't allow it to be displayed:

-rw-r----- 1 root root 10805 Nov 27 19:12 index.php

That seems like you were trying to hide something from me. Not cool.
